### Day 0: March 20th, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up environments and identified challenges for Day 1.

**Thoughts:** Setup environments, as I was not sure whether or not I wanted to focus on Python or Go language. I am going to go with Python to start. I am going to work through Python the Hard Way and Free Code Camps Responsive Web Design Certification.


### Day 1: March 20th, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the first 2 exercises in Learn Python the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** I have completed the first 2 exercises and am pushing all of my exercises to this github repo. The first examples were fairly easy since I am familiar with a basic level of code. But I am going to work through all of these despite, and manage whatever I am doing from github since I work from different laptops occassionaly.I am also using VIM, despite the text saying use the terminal.

### Day 2: March 21st, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through 4 exercises in exercise 3 of in Learn Python the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** I have completed all exercises in exercise 3. Focus was on numerics and mathematic calculations using Python as a calculator and the difference operations.

### Day 3: March 22nd, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through Exercise 4 of Python the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** I have completed exercise 4. This consisted of creating variables for mathmatical functions and then passing those results to another varible to print necessary calculations. I became a bit bored with Python and am switching over to JavaScript. This might be a bit more difficult, to learn and code at the same time, but may be more challenging than python. Also more appropriate to do working in the Cloud and with web applications.

I am also setting up my environment for JavaScript and doing some reading on it today.
