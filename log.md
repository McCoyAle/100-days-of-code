# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 20th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Set up environments and identified challenges for Day 1.

**Thoughts:** Setup environments, as I was not sure whether or not I wanted to focus on Python or Go language. I am going to go with Python to start. I am going to work through Python the Hard Way and Free Code Camps Responsive Web Design Certification.


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
