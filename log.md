**Today's Progress**: Set up environments and identified challenges for Day 1.

**Thoughts:** Setup environments, as I was not sure whether or not I wanted to focus on Python or Go language. I am going to go with Python to start. I am going to work through Python the Hard Way and Free Code Camps Responsive Web Design Certification.


### Day 1: March 20th, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the first 2 exercises in Learn Python the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** I have completed the first 2 exercises and am pushing all of my exercises to this github repo. The first examples were fairly easy since I am familiar with a basic level of code. But I am going to work through all of these despite, and manage whatever I am doing from github since I work from different laptops occassionaly.I am also using VIM, despite the text saying use the terminal.
