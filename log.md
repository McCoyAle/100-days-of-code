### Day 0: March 20th, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up environments and identified challenges for Day 1.

**Thoughts:** Setup environments, as I was not sure whether or not I wanted to focus on Python or Go language. I am going to go with Python to start. I am going to work through Python the Hard Way and Free Code Camps Responsive Web Design Certification.


### Day 1: March 20th, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the first 2 exercises in Learn Python the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** I have completed the first 2 exercises and am pushing all of my exercises to this github repo. The first examples were fairly easy since I am familiar with a basic level of code. But I am going to work through all of these despite, and manage whatever I am doing from github since I work from different laptops occassionaly.I am also using VIM, despite the text saying use the terminal.

### Day 2: March 21st, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through 4 exercises in exercise 3 of in Learn Python the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** I have completed all exercises in exercise 3. Focus was on numerics and mathematic calculations using Python as a calculator and the difference operations.

### Day 3: March 22nd, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through Exercise 4 of Python the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** I have completed exercise 4. This consisted of creating variables for mathmatical functions and then passing those results to another varible to print necessary calculations. I became a bit bored with Python and am switching over to JavaScript. This might be a bit more difficult, to learn and code at the same time, but may be more challenging than python. Also more appropriate to do working in the Cloud and with web applications.

I am also setting up my environment for JavaScript and doing some reading on it today.

### Day 4: March 23rd, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercise 5. 

**Thoughts** Completed Exercise 5 for variables and printing. Forgot to upload log entry although exercise was uploaded. I decided to continue to work with Python in order to better understand fundamentals.

### Day 5: March 24th, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I did not code at all.

**Thoughts** I had to travel for work and did not have time to code. This will be my one day of not coding within a two week period.

### Day 6: March 28th, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I coded exercises 6-10 for a couple of hours.

**Thoughts** I was out of town for work, and was not able to code due to container platform training all week. Picked up on a couple of exercises to catch up. I've not uploaded the chapter 10 folder.

### Day 7: March 30th, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I coded examples for exercise 11.

**Thoughts**: I just worked on raw_input funtion. This exercise seemed a bit more interesting than the previous.

### Day 8: April 1st, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I coded in Golang today. 

**Thought**: I switched from Python to Go. I was not interested in JavaScript and Python started to get a bit boring. Or maybe it was the exercises that I was doing. However, Golang held my interest and since I have absolutely no clue about it, it helps me to focus more. I am using this book [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro) The chapters are short and sweet and focus on some sort of functionality. At the end it follows up with some exercies to implement what you read. I like the straight to the point and then code. I am using it as an introduction and then will follow up with my Go book or just dive into a project that utilizes the language. Another thing that I noticed, is since starting this project I understand git a lot better. I have been using it for open source K8s project, but did not really understand. So pushing to this repo has helped tremendously.

### Day 10: April 3rd, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Coded in Golang and worked on Control Structures.

**Thought**: Today's examples were a bit more difficult. Missing a day in Go feels different from missing a day in Python. However, I will keep pushing. I could not figure out how to print text for a variable divisable by both 3 and 5 in my third example. I had a long day so it could just be a mental block. I will work on it some more. Also need to reread on usage of Go's logical operators.

### Day 9: April 4th, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished updating exercise 5 and completed half of 6. 

**Thought**: Today's subject was arrays. The second half of the chapter is slices, however since I had a long day I am not really thinking clearly so I will complete the rest tomorrow. Arrays and Slices I understand from a simplistic perspective but when time to implement, I don't necessarily know what to do. So I will need to spend a little bit more time on this chapter and possibly find external exercises to work on as well so that it sticks with me in Golang.
